## Project Overview
This is a modern music streaming service built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application features:

- **YouTube API Integration**: Search and stream music from YouTube

- **Music Player**: Full-featured player with controls and visualizations

## Key Technologies
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- YouTube Data API v3 for music search and streaming
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- React Hooks for state management

## Design Guidelines
- Use liquid glass (glassmorphism) design patterns
- Implement smooth but not excessive animations
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- Follow macOS design principles for UI consistency
- Use backdrop-blur effects and translucent backgrounds

## API Integration
- YouTube Data API for music search functionality
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Follow YouTube API terms of service

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, context)
- Follow Next.js best practices for performance
- Maintain clean component architecture
